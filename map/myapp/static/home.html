            <br> Home is more than just a building.It is where the heart feels at peace.<br>
            <br> From cozy corners to the scent of familiar food, every part of a home <br>
            <br>carries emotions and memories.It's where we find safety, love, and connection.<br>
            <br> Whether it'stime with family, celebrations,or quiet moments, home holds a special<br>
            <br> place in everyone's life.                                                        <br>
